*Setup*

Only run initial-setup.bat once. initial-setup.bat is not needed if you already have Pyhton, yt_dlp, keyboard, and termcolor installed on your system.

After inital-setup.bat is does its job, you can create a shortcut to or double click "yt-dlp trbatukim Edition.bat" to run the application.
